19.0 / 2014-06-12
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gunicorn 19.0 is a major release with new features and fixes. This
version improve a lot the usage of Gunicorn with python 3 by adding `two
new workers <http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/latest/design.html#asyncio-workers>`_ to it: `gthread` a fully threaded async worker using futures
and `gaiohttp` a worker using asyncio.


Breaking Changes
----------------

Switch QUIT and TERM signals
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

With this change, when gunicorn receives a QUIT all the workers are
killed immediately and exit and TERM is used for the graceful shutdown.

Note: the old behaviour was based on the NGINX but the new one is more
correct according the following doc:

https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Termination-Signals.html

also it is complying with the way the signals are sent by heroku:

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/python-faq#what-constraints-exist-when-developing-applications-on-heroku

Deprecations
+++++++++++++

`run_gunicorn`, `gunicorn_django` and `gunicorn_paster` are now
completely deprecated and will be removed in the next release. Use the
`gunicorn` command instead.


Changes:
--------

core
++++

- add aiohttp worker named `gaiohttp` using asyncio. Full async worker
  on python 3.
- fix HTTP-violating excess whitespace in write_error output
- fix: try to log what happened in the worker after a timeout, add a
  `worker_abort` hook on SIGABRT signal.

  keep-alive requests after the listener has closed.
